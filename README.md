# You Need Automated Tests

A collection of real quotes from stand-ups that could have been avoided if sane automated tests were developed alongside features, rather than some ending up as some afterthought or deemed in the moment as "not important right now" because we "just need to get a release out ASAP".

- "... and everything _seemed_ to be loading."
- "... check with [DEVELOPER] if it's _okay to deploy_ and _if it works nice_."
- "... it _may_ not fix it entirely."
- "... QA'ing the integration -- overall they _seem_ good to go."
- "Get them to test their project _once it goes live_."
- "Is someone willing to do all that? -- It _has never been tested before_."

Keep an ear out during your next team's stand-up.
- What kind problems keep coming up because of a _lack of confidence_ in your changes and releases?
- What kind of problems could be avoided if you just had some _automated tests_ to replace the your Friday overtime, late-into-the-night manual tests for releases?
